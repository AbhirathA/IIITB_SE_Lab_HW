# Library Management Demo

This demo implements a small public library system in Java.  
It includes **Employees**, **Librarians**, **Customers**, **Books**, **Bookshelves**, and **Public Libraries**.

The `Main.java` file demonstrates all functionality, ensuring each method is called at least once, with aligned separators for clarity.
Also look at **ReadMe.txt** for more explainations regarding the code.

## Instructions to Run the Demo

1. Ensure you have **Java** installed on your system (Java 8+ recommended).
2. Place all `.java` files (`Main.java`, `Employee.java`, `Librarian.java`, `Customer.java`, `Book.java`, `Bookshelf.java`, `PublicLibrary.java`) in the same directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory.
4. Compile all files using:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
